# DOSP Project 1
Introduction
=

The goal of the project 1 is to use ___F#___ and ___Akka Actor Model___ to build a good solution for the _Lucas Square Pyramid_ problem to find __Perfect Square__ on mutiple core.<br>

Problem Definition
=
An interesting problem in arithmetic with deep implications to elliptic curve theory is the problem of finding perfect squares that are sums of consecutive squares. A classic example is the Pythagorean identity:<br>
<center>3<sup>2</sup>+4<sup>2</sup>=5<sup>2</sup></center><br>
that reveals that the sum of squares of 3,4 is itself a square. Amore interesting example is Lucas' Square Pyramid:<br>
<center>1<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+...+24<sup>2</sup>=70<sup>2</sup></center><br>
