#Introduction:<br>
====
The goal of the project 1 is to use _F#_ and _Akka Actor Model_ to build a good solution for the _Lucas Square Pyramid_ problem to find __Perfect Square__ on mutiple core.
#Problem definition<br>
====
An interesting problem in arithmetic with deep implications to elliptic curve theory is the problem of finding perfect squares that are sums of consecutive squares. A classic example is the Pythagorean identity:<br>
3<sup>2</sup>+4<sup>2</sup>=5<sup>2</sup>
